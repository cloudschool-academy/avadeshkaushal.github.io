# Home Lab

Just a brief note on my home lab set-up.

The idea was to leverage every single peice of hardware lying around before decieding to invest in anything new. My main purpose of using the lab is to test and validate the new technologies and services without disrupiting any other services running at home.

Also, I do not have any dedicated space in my house to run servers so even though i'd love to get few I had to be content with old hardware. 

## Harware

1. Two old small form factor based dell desktop.
    * Dell Optiplex XE2 -SFF
    * Dell Optiplex 9020 -SFF

2. An old Dell Laptop with baught in 2014.
   * Dell Inspiron 3500 series
3. An AMD based mid range gaming system build in 2016.
4. Two Switches (one of them being managed switch).
   * Netgrear 5 port switch
   * TP Link SG1016D Managed Switch
5. An Intel NUC (New invenstment)
    * NUC11PAH
    
6. Synology NAS
    * Two bay Nas with 8TB of disk drives.

7. An old rasberry-pi
    * 3B+ model running my VPN

Finally, to house all of this I managed to get hold of old TV-Stand Rack.Since, all my devices luckily are small form factor based and so I am easliy able to stack them in the rack which is open from the back leaving enough space for air flow.

## Virtualization Platform

The idea was always to go for open source stuff, however Intel Nuc was baught with the intention of using it for VMware Esxi. I did configure the same with Esxi7 using custom network drivers and ISO and boy it worked amazing! 
My idea was to purchase the another intel NUC but due to tight budgets I had to hold myself.

So, I decieded to go for proxmox on all my boxes including the Intel NUC.Six months down the line, I think I made the right decision as all my LAB VMs which are critical in nature for me, are now highly available.

### Proxmox/Virtualization Services

- Harware : I have build two node cluster for my based on devices I have.
    *  Dell Optiples 9020 : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570S 4 CPU @ 3.2 GHz with 24 GB of RAM. Enough to run multiple containers and VMs.
    * Intel Nuc : This one is certianly power horse. With 8 Cores and 64 GB ram this one host most of my VMs.
    * Dell Inspiron Laptop: Proxmox sandbox server. With 4 cores and 8 GB ram it good engough to run few VMs and if I need to do any testing of hyper-visor e.g. upgrades etc I use this one.
    * Custom Built Desktop: This desktop was built few years back for playing basic games. It has some nice configuration that includes FX8200 series CPU (8 cores) and 16 GB of RAM which can be upgraded upto 32 GBs. It certainly is fancy and can run amazingly, initially I had proxmox on it as well, but for my need I actually decieded to put Windows 10 Back on it and use WSL etc..It I use Hyper-V on top of this for any isolated testing at time.


## Roles and software choices

The idea here was to build a very very small enviornment with all the services needed to test different scenarios. Since, my professional domain is Infrastructure/DevOps services, I really needed to have a lab which is hybrid in nature. So, below is what I landed:

### Firewall/VPN
 
 I decieded to go for tried and test PFsense. Intially, it was virtualized on one of my proxmox servers but later I decied to dedicate on of the boxes for Pfsense.

#### Details and Services on PFSense

- Hardware : Running on Dell Optiplex XE2. Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570S 4 CPU @ 2.90GHz with 8 GB of RAM.
- I did add dual port gig ethernet card that I found on facebook giving me option to use multiple ports on pfsense.
- Apart from usual firewall my pfsense is used for VPN. My choice is wiregaurd which light and works amazing for such setup.
- Vlans and DHCP are configured at the PFsense level.Dedicated Vlans for specific isolated services.
- I also have site to site VPN configured with my Azure subscription (Visual Studio Enterprise).
- I am also using my PFsense as certificate store. I use Letsencrypt for all my certificate needs across the labs and applications.

### Misc.

- I have dedicated domain for my Lab.
- I use Pi-Hole for my DNS needs. I have it running on my Rasberry Pi and I also have few virtualized nodes running Pi for high availability.
- I do have a bind server for Lab based domain enviornment with proper forwarding setup.
- Public cloud choice offcourse is Microsoft Azure. I do have multiple Visual studio subscriptions availble and hence Azure becomes the automatic choice. I also leverage AWS at times but have to be mindfull to remain within the free tiers and so it more of test,try and destroy sort of ..

That's all about my Lab. Cost wise I believ everything wrapped up under $1500 and I am able to do most of my testing. At time, offcourse I scream for more resources (trust me it's never enough!). In future I may add another Intel Nuc (I love these small powerhoueses) but for now I am happy with my set-up!
